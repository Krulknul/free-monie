This was an experiment to introduce myself to machine learning and learn PyTorch.

It's a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which attempts to predict the daily closing price of any financial asset it had been trained on.
It uses a specific type of RNN called an LSTM, which stands for Long Short Term Memory. It is great for learning on time series datasets.
