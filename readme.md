This was an experiment to introduce myself to machine learning and learn PyTorch.

It's a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which attempts to predict the daily closing price of any financial asset it is trained on. It is supposed to take technical data from N days (opening price, highest, lowest, volume) and return the predicted closing price of the N+1'th day. 
It uses a specific type of RNN called an LSTM, which stands for Long Short Term Memory. They are great for learning on time series datasets.
